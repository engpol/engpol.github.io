  description: In this review, we discuss recent advances in the current research on the GLP-1/GLP-1R system in beta cells, including the regulation of signaling by endocytic trafficking as well as the application of concepts such as signal bias, allosteric modulation, dual agonism, polymorphic receptor variants, spatial compartmentalization of cAMP signaling and new downstream signaling targets involved in the control of beta cell function

- title: "Ureidopeptide GLP-1 analogues with prolonged activity in vivo via signal bias and altered receptor trafficking"
  image: 
  description: Based on molecular dynamics simulations, N-terminally modified GLP-1 analogues with a ureido residue replacement at position 2 were synthesized and showed preservation of agonist activity while exhibiting a substantial increase in stability. This study demonstrates the efficacy of single α-amino acid substitution with ureido residues to design long lasting peptides

- title: "Agonist-induced membrane nanodomain clustering drives GLP-1 receptor responses in pancreatic beta cells"
  image: 
  description: In the present study, we demonstrate an important role for the translocation of active GLP-1Rs into liquid-ordered plasma membrane nanodomains, which act as hotspots for optimal coordination of intracellular signaling and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This process is dynamically regulated by agonist binding through palmitoylation of the GLP-1R at its carboxyl-terminal tail

The differential effect of GLP-1R agonists on capsaicin and ATP responses in neurons suggest they may not affect pain mechanisms mediated by the capsaicin receptor TRPV1, but may enhance the effects of purinergic agonists

Compared to a panel of FDA-approved GLP-1 mimetics, compounds that retain GLP-1R at the plasma membrane produce greater long-term insulin release, which is dependent on a reduction in β-arrestin recruitment and faster agonist dissociation rates

We identify five (clathrin, dynamin1, AP2, sorting nexins [SNX] SNX27, and SNX1) that increase and four (huntingtin-interacting protein 1 [HIP1], HIP14, GASP-1, and Nedd4) that decrease insulin secretion from murine insulinoma MIN6B1 cells in response to the GLP-1 analog exendin-4
